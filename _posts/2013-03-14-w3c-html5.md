今天为 HTML5 找一个 favicon.ico，意外发现，之前被 Google 报 404 的 [html5rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/) 翻墙之后可看，而且还有[中文版](http://www.html5rocks.com/zh/)，太开心！

为什么墙内会 404 呢？

这个 [Presentation](http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide) 做得真心不错，极好的 HTML5 培训资料，就是体积太大，只能 Host 在本地。

This presentation was created by Marcin Wichary and modified by many people in the Google Chrome team. 

其实，MS Apple 都发布过 HTML5 体验网站：

**Microsoft HTML5 Labs**

[http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/](http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/)

The HTML5 Labs site is a place where we want to share with the community, experimental implementations of early drafts of specifications from the W3C, IETF and other standards organizations.

微软另外两个体验 HTML5 的作品：

[Meet the New Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/cmpn/demo)

[Internet Explorer Test Drive](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/)

**Apple HTML5**

[http://www.apple.com/html5/](http://www.apple.com/html5/)

Every new Apple mobile device and every new Mac — along with the latest version of Apple’s Safari web browser — supports web standards including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. These web standards are open, reliable, highly secure, and efficient. They allow web designers and developers to create advanced graphics, typography, animations, and transitions. Standards aren’t add-ons to the web. They are the web. And you can start using them today.

回说 Logo

HTML5 至今未统一标准，不过 w3 组织在 Logo 上都已经狠下功夫，用心良苦：

[http://www.w3.org/html/logo/](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/)

TAKE CONTROL — YOUR WEB, YOUR LOGO

It stands strong and true, resilient and universal as the markup you write. It shines as bright and as bold as the forward-thinking, dedicated web developers you are. It's the standard's standard, a pennant for progress. And it certainly doesn't use tables for layout.

We present an HTML5 logo.

Imagination, meet implementation. HTML5 is the cornerstone of the W3C's open web platform; a framework designed to support innovation and foster the full potential the web has to offer. Heralding this revolutionary collection of tools and standards, the HTML5 identity system provides the visual vocabulary to clearly classify and communicate our collective efforts.

为您的网站添加 favicon.ico

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/ico">
{%endhighlight%}
