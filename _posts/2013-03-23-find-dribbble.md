为了换一个好看的 Sublime Text 2 图标，发现了这个网站：

**SHOW AND TELL FOR DESIGNERS**

What are you working on? Dribbble is a community of designers answering that question each day. Web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, icon artists, typographers, logo designers, and other creative types share small screenshots (shots) that show their work, process, and current projects.

Dribbble is a place to show and tell, promote, discover, and explore design.

Headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts, Dribbble began as a side project and is now a tiny, bootstrapped and profitable company helping the world's design talent share their creations and get hired. Dribbble has become a go-to resource for discovering and connecting with designers around the globe.

太多惊艳的作品，每一个发布作品的设计师，都是那么可爱：

专业，谦逊，幽默：

**Chris Lee**

I am by no means an icon designer (as in I literally never do this stuff; not my forte) and I can't say I spent more than five minutes on this, but I had an idea in my head and wanted to take a stab at rendering it with my limited skills. I think it's at least an improvement over the current icon.

If I were actually any good at this I'd try to make it more like the vision in my head, which is basically this but with a slightly transparent glass material and some neat, subtle lighting effects. [>>>](http://dribbble.com/shots/382409-Sublime-Text-2-Icon)

最终选择了这个：

[Sublime Text 2 (update) - Replacement Icon](http://dribbble.com/shots/382465-Sublime-Text-2-update-Replacement-Icon)

在这里我也找到了一枚漂亮的 [Xee icons](http://dribbble.com/search?q=xee)

**Roy van Dijk**

Xee is a free Image Viewer for mac which me and some colleagues are using, simply because it's much better than the standard "Preview." **The only problem is that we didn't really like the icon**. So I created my own.

Update: .icns file is now attached as well. [>>>](http://dribbble.com/shots/711126-Xee-app-icon)

Awesome! Xee is my favourite Preview.app replacement for OS X. Could you provide .icns file as well please? :)

*Niels Mulder*

Thanks Roy, hated that old icon!

全文完。
